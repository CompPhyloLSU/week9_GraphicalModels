The broad search haWs a smaller range in the trace plot than the narrow search. This could be due to the narrow search trying to make moves outside of the
search range, making it more difficult to move. Both analyses do display "fuzzy catepillar" shapes. Looking through the MCMC output in revbayes, 
there is very small movement and it tends to stabilize within 2000 repetitions. While it is possible that this is continuously occuring due to some 
super efficient algorithm, it is more likely an issue with the dnNorm command being used to draw values after the parameters for it are drawn from 
a uniform distribution. I tried to use both dnorm and rnorm with 10 draws, but the yeilded the same result as the dnNorm that was used in the for loop.
There is some error that I just cannot recognize. Both of the MCMC runs do wind up converging on a result though, which is good.
