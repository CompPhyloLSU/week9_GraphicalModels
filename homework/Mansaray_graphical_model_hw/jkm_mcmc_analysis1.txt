I'm not totally confident in my results. The values of the mean and HPD are negative and the estimates graph is to the left. 
However, there doesn't seem to be a trend in the trace and it does resemble the "fuzzy caterpillar" we talked about in class. I think providing more informative priors could clarify the results. 
The peaks go up and down but I had a difficult time adjusting my proposals to get it to look the way it does.
