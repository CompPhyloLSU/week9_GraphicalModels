When I look at the tracer file after 100,000 generations (as shown here)
I am quite confident in the estimation of the parameters. When I use
1,000,000 generations I get the same result and a fairly similar tracer file.
However, at 10,000 generations the parameter estimates were fairly similar but the
tracer file did not yet look like it had converged, so I would be less confident
in those parameter estimates. My more informative prior was simply a narrower range
for the uniform distribution, so it is possible that it did not substantially
affect the overall MCMC, at least not past the beginning of the burnin. For the
10,000 generation run the chain looked somewhat better with the more informative
prior, but for the longer runs they seem essentially the same. Probably it would
be necessary to have a much more informative prior (either a much narrower
uniform distribution or something like a normal distribution) to see much of a
change in the final results after a long MCMC chain.
