###Notes for Week 9 Exercise

#Creating an MCMC analysis for a Normal Distribution

#My original model included two stochastic nodes for mean (m) and standard deviation (sd), obtained from 2 "fixed" or constant values from 0 to 25 for mean and 0 to 4 for sd

Discussion of Tracer plots from first run output (log file) for the first run of 10000 generations on MCMC analysis:
-Initial values for mean and sd were obtained with the statements:
m ~ dnUnif(0,25) = 23.48396
sd ~ dnUnif(0,4) = 2.65924
-My first set of random observations (priors) were: [ 25.915, 23.630, 21.540, 21.495, 22.366, 23.696, 25.283, 20.525, 21.344, 21.505 ]. These values were clamped to each new draw from a normal distribution.
-Tracer showed a normal distribution of my values of m ranging from 23.25 to 24.
-The distributions of my posteriors and likelihood were very similar to each other, but their overall values of density were different. Distribution of my priors was different, with a more more prominent peak compared to posteriors and likelihood.

Dicussion of Tracer plots after new priors were added:
-I selected values of m from my last 1000 generations from my previous run and added to my code.
-New set of priors to be clamped: [23.80207, 23.77513, 23.75037, 23.71122, 23.68676, 23.71109, 23.71073, 23.68241, 23.66532, 23.65548]. The new analysis was ran using the same values of mean and standard deviation as above.
-When the new set of priors was used, the marginal density of the mean improved a little, being somewhat more prominent in the midpoint of the distribution "hill" and a new estimate of the mean was calculated. The marginal density increased for the second run with new priors.
