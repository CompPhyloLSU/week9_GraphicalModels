###Notes for Week 9 Exercise

#Creating an MCMC analysis for a Normal Distribution

#My original model included two stochastic nodes for mean (m) and standard deviation (sd), obtained from 2 "fixed" or constant values from 0 to 25 for mean and 0 to 4 for sd

Discussion of Tracer plots from first run output (log file) for the first run of 10000 generations on MCMC analysis:
-Initial values for mean and sd were obtained with the statements:
m ~ dnUnif(0,25) = 13.18109
sd ~ dnUnif(0,4) = 1.870544
-My first set of random observations based on a for loop using a normal distribution with the values of m and sd drawn above were: [ 25.915, 23.630, 21.540, 21.495, 22.366, 23.696, 25.283, 20.525, 21.344, 21.505 ]. These values were clamped to each new draw from a normal distribution in our stochastic node for my "d" plate .
-Tracer showed a normal distribution of my values of m ranging from 13 to 16 and sd ranging from 2 to 4.
-I got the hairy peaks for the "Trace" plot of my priors, posteriors, means, and sd estimates, meaning that my sampling and moves were somewhat acceptable.

Dicussion of Tracer plots after new priors were added:
-I selected values for new priors of m and sd based on the results from my first run. I used m ~ dnUnif(13,16) to ramdonly draw a new value for m
and sd ~ dnUnif(2,4) for sd based on the results of my first run.
-New set of priors to be clamped: I clamped the same set of values (obs) as before [ 25.915, 23.630, 21.540, 21.495, 22.366, 23.696, 25.283, 20.525, 21.344, 21.505 ]. The new analysis was ran using the same values of mean and standard deviation as above.
-When the new set of priors was used, the marginal density of the mean improved a little, being somewhat more prominent in the midpoint of the distribution "hill" and a new estimate of the mean was calculated. The marginal density increased for the second run with new priors. The two distributions overlaped a little, suggesting that if more analysis are ran, with new (improved) priors we would have closer distributions.
